Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass, they wanted us to create a website for their students to be able to schedule in person classes with instuctors.

What did you do particularly well?
I feel what I did best was creating easy to read diagrams for the developement process.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would redo my use diagram and add more unique identifiers for the different actors.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I implemented exactly what they said and added the needed supporting systems to complete the project. This is important as without this the customer will be unsatisfied.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
For designing software I try to implament the requirements in the simplist and easist to read way possible. The techniques I would use in the future would be
how to create all of the different diagrams I learned in this class.
